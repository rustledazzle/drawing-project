	<p>&nbsp; For example, the large eyes of anime characters are commonly perceived in Japan as multifaceted  </p>
 	<p>&nbsp; “windows to the soul.” Much of the genre is aimed at children, but anime films are sometimes marked by </p>
	<p>&nbsp; adult themes and subject matter. Modern anime began in 1956 and found lasting success in 1961 with the </p>
	<p>&nbsp; establishment of Mushi Productions by Osamu Tezuka, a leading figure in modern manga, the dense, </p>
	<p>&nbsp; novelistic Japanese comic book style that contributed greatly to the aesthetic of anime. Anime such </p> 
	<p>&nbsp; as Miyazaki Hayao’s Princess Mononoke (1997) are the modern equivalent of the epic folk adventures </p>
	<p>&nbsp; once filmed by Japanese masters such as Mizoguchi Kenji and Kurosawa Akira. </p>

	How to make Anime</font></h1>
<h2 align="center"><font face= "Comic sans MS" size="5" color ="lime">
	Getting the Green Light</font></h2>
	
	<p> Every anime has to start with a story idea. There are three main sources of story for anime: manga, &nbsp;</p>
	<p> light novels, and original scripts. Obviously, story ideas can come from anywhere, but popular manga and &nbsp;</p> 
	<p>books in Japan make a lot of sense to use since they already have a fanbase. &nbsp;</p>
	

<h2 align="center"><font face= "Comic sans MS" size="5" color="#06FFD5">
	The Pre-production Phase &nbsp;
	</font></h2>
	<p>“Pre-production” is the phase of the project before anyone has actually started making the show. All film and television &nbsp;</p>
	<p>projects have a pre-production phase; the length of this can vary widely, based on several factors such as how big the project &nbsp;</p>
	<p>is going to be, how much money is needed, and so on. </p>

<p style="float:left;"><img src="draw.gif" height="300px" width="300px" border="0px" ></p>
	<p>&nbsp; The director plays an important role in this. He or she will be part of pre-production because they have  </p>
	<p>&nbsp; the say when it comes to hiring the rest of production crew. Just as in Hollywood, to fill key positions  </p>
	<p>&nbsp; directors will hire people they trust and have worked with before. Directors are the creative head of the  </p>
	<p>&nbsp; project; not the business head. So they have to work with the budgets and deadlines agreed upon with </p>
	<p>&nbsp; the producers.</p>

<h2 align="center"><font face= "Comic sans MS" size="5" color="#5DADE2">
	A Word on Animation
	</font></h2>
	<p>&nbsp; In case you didn’t know, animation works by quickly flipping through drawings of different phases of </p>
	<p>&nbsp; motion in order to create the illusion of actual motion. Film works the same way, but each “frame”  </p>
	<p>&nbsp; is a photograph rather than a drawing. I’m just mentioning it, because keeping the nature of animation in mind will allow the next phases </p>
	<p>&nbsp; to make more sense.</p>

<p style="float:right;"><img src="kon.gif" height="300px" width="300px" border="0px" ></p>
<h2 align="center"><font face= "Comic sans MS" size="5" color="violet">
	Storyboards
	</font></h2>
	<p> The script describes the story in terms of scenes and dialogue, but it’s not a visual representation. The  &nbsp;</p>
	<p> director needs to turn the script into a visual  guide in order to communicate to the animators exactly what   &nbsp;</p>
 	<p> he wants.That’s where a “storyboard” comes in. This is a set of rough sketches that detail what  is meant  &nbsp;</p>
	<p> to happen in each scene. It also shows what scene layouts should look like and so on. There may also be &nbsp;</p>
	<p> concept art if the story doesn’t already have  visual design,as a manga would. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="float:left;"><img src="Nao.gif" height="320px" width="300px" border="2px" ></p>
<h2 align="center"><font face= "Comic sans MS" size="5" color="lime">
	Creating Layout
	</font></h2>
	<p> &nbsp; Since this is animation, there’s no actual “camera” filming scenes. Instead, “layouts” are created from  </p>
	<p> &nbsp; the storyboard that show what the background and perspective should look like, where cuts will happen, </p>
	<p> &nbsp; and how the “camera” will move. Layout design is where animation production really begins.</p>

<h2 align="center"><font face= "Comic sans MS" size="5" color="red">
	Key Animation &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
	</font></h2>
	<p> &nbsp; The layouts are given to the key animators. They will create the high-quality key frames. That is, the  </p>
	
 	<p> &nbsp; first and last frame of any smooth  motion on screen, such as someone turning their head, pulling back for </p>
	<p> &nbsp; a punch, changing facial expression, and so on.</p>

<h2 align="center"><font face= "Comic sans MS" size="5" color="#45B39D">
	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; In Between Artists
	</font></h2>
	<p> The unenviable job of drawing all those frames goes to another type of animator called an “in-between” artist. As you’ve probably figured out, </p>
	<p> this person draws all the frames between the key frames. Luckily they don’t have to draw every single frame for every second of footage. </p>
	<p> Drawing a separate cel for every single frame in a given second is referred to as “animating on ones” in the industry. That sort of fluid motion </p>
	<p> is only reserved for big budget productions or for specific scenes (such as fights) that justify the extra effort. Most of the time, a show will </p>
	<p> be animated on “twos” or even “threes”. In other words, only every second or third frame is is animated.</p>

	Going Digital &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
	</font></h2>
	<p> These days, regardless of how animation starts it inevitably ends up as digital media. Once the animation teams are done, everything needs to  </p>
	<p> be colored. The colored cels are put against the backgrounds as per the layouts. In modern anime this is also where CG elements are added.   </p>
	<p> Now everything must be filmed together as a composite to create the final video.</p>

<p style="float:right;"><img src="Nao1.gif" height="320px" width="300px" border="2px" ></p>
<h2 align="center"><font face= "Comic sans MS" size="5" color="#E74C3C">
	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; After Animation Ends
	</font></h2>
	<p> Anime aren’t silent movies! This means there’s still quite a lot to do. The voice artists need to breathe &nbsp;</p>
	<p> life  into the characters, so final or near final animation is sent to the dubbing studio where voice tracks &nbsp; </p>
	<p> can be created. We still also need things like ambient sound, sound effects, music, and any other audio &nbsp;</p> 
	<p> work such as mixing and mastering to be done.</p><br />

	<p> After all this work, your episode is basically ready to ship out, and then you get to start the whole  &nbsp;</p>
	<p> process all over again!</p><br />

	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For the Sake of Accuracy
	</font></h2>
	<p> &nbsp; I hope it’s clear that these are just the broad strokes of anime production. There’s a lot  </p> 
	<p> &nbsp; more fine detail that there simply isn’t space enough here to go through. This is also a sort</p>
	<p> &nbsp; of naive order and clinical description. In real life, anime projects can be chaotic and follow</p>
	<p> &nbsp; their own weird order and schedule. So don’t think of this as a recipe for making anime, but</p>
	<p> &nbsp; rather a list of main ingredients. Each studio will bake their anime in a different way.</p>	<br /><br />
	<p> Making anime is largely a thankless job. Japanese animators get paid very little and have to work brutal hours; yet they possess amazing </p>
	<p> artistic talent. This is not a career you get into to make a ton of money. It’s an art driven by passion, and knowing how this particular </p>
	<p> sausage is made helps us appreciate it even more.</p>
